# Dog-Breed-Identification
# Dog Vision Project üêïüì∏
Overview
The Dog Vision Project is a deep learning-based application designed to classify dog breeds from images. By using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), the project enables users to upload an image of a dog and receive a predicted breed. The aim is to demonstrate the practical application of image classification using advanced machine learning techniques.

# Features
Upload an image of a dog and receive the predicted breed.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
Supports predictions for over 100 dog breeds.
Uses a pre-trained CNN model for efficient and reliable predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for building the application.
TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks used for developing the CNN model.
# Access to Dataset and Models
Due to GitHub's size limitations, the full dataset and trained models are available on Google Drive. You can download them from the link below:
